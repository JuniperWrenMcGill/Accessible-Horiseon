#Accessible Horiseon

## What's the Motivation?

This is a challenge provided by UNCC's Coding Bootcamp to practice skills learned in class. The value of interacting with code in a real-world scenario is invaluable and solidifies the concepts learned throughout the class. 

## Why Build This?

The focus of this project was to enhance user-friendliness and accessibility. 

## What Problem Does It Solve?
I corrected several problems throughout this project. Including adding semantic html to the source code, added accessible alt attribute to img elements, debugged the css code, and other issues not mentioned here.  

## What Did I Learn?
While revitalizing the code, I learned how important it is to pay close attention as you add semantic HTML. It can break your CSS, and you will need to note where things are. In future projects, I will be labeling before making changes to speed up working time.

## Installation

I cloned the starter code from my class repository to my local repository and synchronized it with a new repository on my GitHub account.
